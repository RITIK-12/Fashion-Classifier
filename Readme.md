Built and trained a neural network that can classify the images in the Fashion MNIST dataset in the Chrome Browser. Implemented it using TensorFlow.js along with the tfjs-vis library. 
On completion of training , one can draw any of the 10 articles of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset on the black rectangle to be classified. After drawing an article of clothing, and pressing the "classify" button, the code will alert the predicted article of clothing.
